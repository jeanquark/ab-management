			subtitle2: 'Art, an alternative asset class',
			paragraph2: 'To sell and to invest in art is an art in itself. In 2011, the size of the art market was estimated at USD 60 billion by the European Fine Art Foundation. Investing in art is a solid investment choice as it never goes bankrupt, so if you love it, buy it. And if you choose well, one day you will be able to sell it for a profit. This is where we come in. When you are ready to sell part or all of your art collection and wish to avoid auctions, we can introduce you to potential buyers, collectors and UHNWI. Various possibilities are also available to protect the anonymity of our clients.'
